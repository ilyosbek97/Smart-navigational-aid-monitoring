# Smart-Navigational-Aid-Monitoring

## 1. Project Overview
### Introduction
Navigation aids, such as buoys and lighthouses, play a crucial role in ensuring maritime safety. However, these aids are often installed in remote areas and are susceptible to damage from collisions, harsh weather, and environmental factors. This project aims to develop an **AI & IoT-based Smart Navigation Aids Monitoring System** that can detect and report malfunctions or damage in real time.

### Objectives
- Develop a real-time monitoring system for navigation aids using AI and IoT technologies.
- Detect damage or malfunctions in navigation aids (e.g., buoys, lighthouses) using sensor-based monitoring.
- Enable remote tracking and maintenance of maritime navigation aids to enhance operational efficiency.
- Expand functionality to marine environmental monitoring (temperature, seismic activity, tsunamis, etc.).

## 2. Problem Statement
### Current Issues
1. **Difficulty in monitoring**: Navigation aids are installed in remote maritime locations, making it difficult to check for damage or malfunctions regularly.
2. **Frequent damage & costly repairs**: Collisions with ships and harsh marine conditions often cause damage, leading to high maintenance costs.
3. **Limited functionality**: Existing systems are primarily used for navigation only, without additional data collection capabilities.
4. **Lack of real-time monitoring**: No efficient system exists to immediately detect and report problems with navigation aids.

### Proposed Solution
- Implement AI-based damage detection using cameras and impact sensors.
- Use IoT connectivity (LTE-M, NB-IoT, LoRa, satellite, etc.) for real-time data transmission.
- Monitor marine environmental conditions (temperature, seismic activity, tsunami detection).
- Develop a scalable and adaptable system for future expansion and commercialization.
